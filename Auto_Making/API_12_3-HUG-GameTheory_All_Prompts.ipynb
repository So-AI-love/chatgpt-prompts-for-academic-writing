Students with a GPA of less than 3.0 may be considered for provisional admission and should contact an enrollment adviser for more information. Aptitude tests, such as the GRE, are not required for admission. You will also need to submit the following application materials: Official college transcripts,\n",

            "Your resume,\n",

            "A personal statement of up to 1,000 words describing the reasons behind your decision to pursue this degree. Campuses may waive some of these requirements as part of the comprehensive application process. International Guidelines This program welcomes online students from around the world. Online students do not qualify for an F-1 Student Visa to travel to the U.S., but instead can participate in our online courses remotely. If your native language is not English and/or you attended school outside of the U.S., you will likely need to provide proof of English language proficiency and an official translation or evaluation of academic transcripts. Requirements will vary based on a student’s academic history and home campus policies. For guidance about these requirements and how they apply to your specific situation, contact your preferred home campus admissions office. If you would like to apply as an International Student for an on-campus program in the UW System please refer to these resources through UW-HELP. Application Deadline All application materials need to be submitted two weeks prior to the semester start to be considered for admission. How to Apply While you are free to apply on your own, many prospective students find it helpful to speak with an enrollment adviser first. Step 1. Select a home campus from our list of program partners: UW-Green Bay, UW-Oshkosh, UW-Parkside, UW-Stout, or UW-Superior. Learn more about our campus partners and choosing a home campus. Step 2. Apply to your preferred home campus using the University of Wisconsin System Online Admission Application. A nonrefundable $56 application fee is required for most graduate degree-seeking students applying to a UW System institution.* *For a limited time, UW Extended Campus is offering an application fee waiver to those who haven’t yet applied for the Spring, Summer, or Fall 2024 semesters. To redeem, use coupon code APPLY24 on the UW Online Application payment page. Step 3. Send your resume, personal statement, and letters of recommendation; and arrange to have your official college transcripts (from each institution you attended) sent to the graduate student admissions office of the home campus to which you applied. Please request electronic transcripts, if this service is offered by your previous school(s), to be sent directly to the admissions email of your chosen home campus. Electronic transcripts are usually delivered more quickly than physical copies sent by mail.\n",

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |\n",

However, there is one potential bug in the check_answer method of the Game class. The issue is with the line self.next_question() which is called immediately after updating the score.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |\n",
