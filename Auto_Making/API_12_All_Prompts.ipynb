        "PARAGRAPH = \"The Android Application for Turkey country and Sustainable Food Waste Management is a project developed by Terraformation, a startup company with a mission to create an international environmental governance. The company envisions a world where sustainability is at the forefront of all economic activities, and where waste is managed in a responsible and efficient manner.  The problem that Terraformation aims to solve is the growing issue of food waste. In Turkey, it is estimated that 19 million tons of food is wasted each year, which not only has a significant impact on the environment but also on the economy and society. This waste also contributes to global warming, as it produces methane gas when it decomposes in landfills.  The Android application developed by Terraformation aims to tackle this problem by providing a platform for individuals and businesses to easily and efficiently manage their food waste. The app will connect users with compost collection services, similar to how Uber connects users with transportation services. This will not only help reduce food waste but also promote sustainable practices and create a circular economy.  The ultimate goal of Terraformation is to create a global network of sustainable food waste management, where individuals and businesses can easily access compost collection services and contribute to a more sustainable future. By leveraging technology and innovation, Terraformation aims to make a positive impact on the environment and society.\" # @param {type:\"string\"}\n",

            "prompt is : ['suggest one Business Plans repost Title in less than 15 word, based of This Topic :(Sustainable Food Waste Management: A ChatGPT-Powered Business Plan Solution with critical viewpoint ) and the description:(The Android Application for Turkey country and Sustainable Food Waste Management is a project developed by Terraformation, a startup company with a mission to create an international environmental governance. The company envisions a world where sustainability is at the forefront of all economic activities, and where waste is managed in a responsible and efficient manner.  The problem that Terraformation aims to solve is the growing issue of food waste. In Turkey, it is estimated that 19 million tons of food is wasted each year, which not only has a significant impact on the environment but also on the economy and society. This waste also contributes to global warming, as it produces methane gas when it decomposes in landfills.  The Android application developed by Terraformation aims to tackle this problem by providing a platform for individuals and businesses to easily and efficiently manage their food waste. The app will connect users with compost collection services, similar to how Uber connects users with transportation services. This will not only help reduce food waste but also promote sustainable practices and create a circular economy.  The ultimate goal of Terraformation is to create a global network of sustainable food waste management, where individuals and businesses can easily access compost collection services and contribute to a more sustainable future. By leveraging technology and innovation, Terraformation aims to make a positive impact on the environment and society..', '1.
