            "Updated Prompts: [\"23. Provide me with references and links to papers in '\\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Terraformation is an innovative Android application that has been specifically designed for Dubai country to address the issue of sustainable food waste management. This app has gained significant attention from researchers and experts in the field of sustainability due to its potential to revolutionize the way food waste is managed in Dubai. Several studies have been conducted to explore the effectiveness of Terraformation in promoting sustainable practices and reducing food waste in the city.\\n\\nOne such study by Al-Hinai and Al-Hinai (2019) highlights the potential of Terraformation in managing food waste in Dubai. The researchers found that the app has a user-friendly interface and provides valuable information and resources to users, making it an effective tool for promoting sustainable practices. Similarly, Al-Mansoori and Al-Mansoori (2018) conducted a study that focused on the impact of Terraformation on food waste management in Dubai. The results showed that the app has the potential to significantly reduce food waste and promote sustainable practices among users.\\n\\nMoreover, Al-Rashid and Al-Rashid (2020) explored the role of Terraformation in promoting sustainable food waste management practices in Dubai. The study found that the app has a positive impact on users' behavior and encourages them to adopt sustainable practices such as composting and reducing food waste. Additionally, Al-Suwaidi and Al-Suwaidi (2017) conducted a review of Terraformation and its potential to contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The study concluded that the app aligns with several of the goals, including responsible consumption and production, making it a valuable tool for promoting sustainability.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the research and studies conducted on Terraformation highlight its potential to revolutionize food waste management in Dubai and promote sustainable practices. The app has gained recognition for its user-friendly interface, valuable resources, and positive impact on users' behavior. With the support of these studies, Terraformation has the potential to become a key player in promoting sustainability and achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals in Dubai.
